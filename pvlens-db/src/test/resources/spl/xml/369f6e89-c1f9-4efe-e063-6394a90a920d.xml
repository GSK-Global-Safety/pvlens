                     <title>5.1 Effects on Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials, dutasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in subjects with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. dutasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men taking dutasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on dutasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with dutasteride may also affect PSA test results.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with dutasteride for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men.The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of dutasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as dutasteride monotherapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5 ng/mL and 10.0 ng/mL taking dutasteride in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (dutasteride 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) [see

At 52 weeks, compared with placebo, dutasteride treatment resulted in mean reduction in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility; the effects on total sperm count were not reversible after 24 weeks of follow-up. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected and mean values for all semen parameters remained within the normal range at all timepoints. The clinical significance of the effect of dutasteride on semen characteristics for an individual patient’s fertility is not known [see

Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 4,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of dutasteride capsules (n = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had “for-cause biopsies” at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride capsules (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [see

The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking dutasteride capsules was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had co-morbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between dutasteride capsules, alone or in combination with tamsulosin, and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial

                        <paragraph>Dutasteride is contraindicated for use in pregnancy because it may cause harm to the male fetus [see
 
  <linkHtml href="#ID_d10adf87-3a4b-4fbc-b1f4-70722a8c4bb1">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]. Dutasteride is not indicated for use in women.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteridem is a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses is an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of this conversion. These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male offspring when given to rats or rabbits during organogenesis at less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg daily, in the absence of maternal toxicity. At 15 times the MRHD, prolonged pregnancy, decreased reproductive organ weights, and delayed puberty in male offspring were observed in rats, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily. Increased placental weights in rabbits were also observed, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily

                        <paragraph>Although dutasteride is secreted into human semen, the drug concentration in the human female partner is approximately 100 times less than concentrations producing abnormalities of male genitalia in animal studies (see Data). In monkeys dosed during organogenesis at blood concentrations comparable to or above levels to which a human female partner is estimated to be exposed, male offspring external genitalia was not adversely affected. No feminization occurred in male offspring of untreated female rats mated to treated male rats even though detectable blood levels of dutasteride were observed in the female rats [see

                           <content styleCode="italics">Human Data:</content>The highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men was 14 ng/mL. Although dutasteride is detected in semen, assuming exposure of a 50-kg woman to 5 mL of semen and 100% absorption, the woman’s expected dutasteride blood concentration through semen would be about 0.0175 ng/mL. This concentration is approximately 100 times less than blood concentrations producing abnormalities of male genitalia in animal studies. Dutasteride is highly protein bound in human semen (greater than 96%), which may reduce the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption.

                           <content styleCode="italics">Animal Data:</content>In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, oral administration of dutasteride at 10 times less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily (based on average blood levels in men) resulted in feminization of male genitalia in the fetus (decreased anogenital distance at 0.05 mg/kg/day, with a lack of a no-effect level) in the absence of maternal toxicity. In addition, nipple development, hypospadias, and distended preputial glands occurred in fetuses of dams treated at doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the MRHD). Reduced fetal body weight and associated delayed ossification in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain) were observed at maternal exposure approximately 15 times the MRHD (dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater). An increase in stillborn pups was observed in dams treated at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 111 times the MRHD), with a no-effect level of 12.5 mg/kg/day.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a rabbit embryo-fetal development study, doses 28 times the MRHD (doses of 30 mg/kg/day or greater), based on average blood levels in men, were administered orally on Gestation Days 7 to 29 (during organogenesis and the late period of external genitalia development). Histological evaluation of the genital papilla of fetuses revealed evidence of feminization of the male fetus as well as fused skull bones and increased placental weights at all doses in the absence of maternal toxicity. A second embryo-fetal development study in rabbits dosed throughout pregnancy (organogenesis and later period of external genitalia development [Gestation Days 6 to 29]) at 0.3 times the MRHD (doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day or greater, with no no-effect level), also produced evidence of feminization of the genitalia in male fetuses and increased placental weights at all doses in the absence of maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rhesus monkeys were exposed intravenously during organogenesis (Gestation Days 20 to 100) to a dutasteride blood level comparable to or above the estimated dutasteride exposure of a human female partner. Dutasteride was administered on Gestation Days 20 to 100 (during organogenesis) at doses of 400, 780, 1,325, or 2,010 ng/day (12 monkeys/group). No feminization of male external genitalia of monkey offspring was observed. Reduction of fetal adrenal weights, reduction in fetal prostate weights, and increases in fetal ovarian and testis weights were observed at the highest dose tested. Based on the highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men (14 ng/mL), these doses in the monkey represent up to 16 times the potential maximum exposure of a 50-kg human female to 5 mL of semen daily from a dutasteride-treated male, assuming 100% absorption. The dose levels (on a ng/kg basis) administered to monkeys in this study are 32 to 186 times the nominal (ng/kg) dose to which a female would potentially be exposed via the semen. It is not known whether rabbits or rhesus monkeys produce any of the major human metabolites.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an oral pre-and post-natal development study in rats, feminization of the male genitalia was observed. Decreased anogenital distance was observed at 0.05 times the MRHD and greater (0.05 mg/kg/day and greater), with a lack of a no-effect level, based on average blood levels in men as an estimation of AUC. Hypospadias and nipple development were observed at 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater (14 times the MRHD or greater, with a no-effect level at 0.05 mg/kg/day). Doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day and greater also resulted in prolonged gestation in the parental females, an increase in time to balano-preputial separation in male offspring, a decrease in time to vaginal patency for female offspring, and a decrease in prostate and seminal vesicle weights in male offspring. Increased stillbirths and decreased neonatal viability in offspring were noted at 30 mg/kg/day (102 times the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity [decreased body weights]).</paragraph>

At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all timepoints remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of dutasteride’s effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient’s fertility is not known [see

                        <paragraph>The effect of hepatic impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. Because dutasteride is extensively metabolized, exposure could be higher in hepatically impaired patients. However, in a clinical trial where 60 subjects received 5 mg (10 times the therapeutic dose) daily for 24 weeks, no additional adverse events were observed compared with those observed at the therapeutic dose of 0.5 mg [see

                  <paragraph>Dutasteride is a white to pale yellow powder with a melting point of 242° to 250°C. It is soluble in ethanol (44 mg/mL), methanol (64 mg/mL), and polyethylene glycol 400 (3 mg/mL), but it is insoluble in water.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each dutasteride capsule, administered orally, contains 0.5 mg of dutasteride dissolved in a mixture of mono-di-glycerides of caprylic/capric acid and butylated hydroxytoluene. The inactive excipients in the capsule shell are gelatin (from certified BSE-free bovine sources), glycerin, titanium dioxide, ferric oxide (yellow), and medium chain triglyceride. The red edible ink contains ammonium hydroxide, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, red iron oxide, shellac glaze and simethicone.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT. DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. The type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the type 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks. After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year, 93% at 2 years, and 95% at both 3 and 4 years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years, 26% at 3 years, and 22% at 4 years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793 pg/g, respectively,

These 5 alpha-reductase-deficient males have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to 5 alpha-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals.</paragraph>

Statistically significant, baseline-adjusted mean increases compared with placebo were observed for total testosterone at 8 weeks (97.1 ng/dL,

The median percentage changes from baseline within the dutasteride group were 17.9% for testosterone at 8 weeks and 12.4% for thyroid-stimulating hormone at 52 weeks. After stopping dutasteride for 24 weeks, the mean levels of testosterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone had returned to baseline in the group of subjects with available data at the visit. In subjects with BPH treated with dutasteride in a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, there was a median percent increase in luteinizing hormone of 12% at 6 months and 19% at both 12 and 24 months.

                              <paragraph>Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro studies showed that dutasteride is metabolized by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. Both of these isoenzymes produced the 4′-hydroxydutasteride, 6-hydroxydutasteride, and the 6,4′-dihydroxydutasteride metabolites. In addition, the 15-hydroxydutasteride metabolite was formed by CYP3A4. Dutasteride is not metabolized in vitro by human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In human serum following dosing to steady state, unchanged dutasteride, 3 major metabolites (4′-hydroxydutasteride, 1,2-dihydrodutasteride, and 6-hydroxydutasteride), and 2 minor metabolites (6,4′-dihydroxydutasteride and 15-hydroxydutasteride), as assessed by mass spectrometric response, have been detected. The absolute stereochemistry of the hydroxyl additions in the 6 and 15 positions is not known. In vitro, the 4′-hydroxydutasteride and 1,2-dihydrodutasteride metabolites are much less potent than dutasteride against both isoforms of human 5 alpha-reductase. The activity of 6β-hydroxydutasteride is comparable to that of dutasteride.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Dutasteride and its metabolites were excreted mainly in feces. As a percent of dose, there was approximately 5% unchanged dutasteride (~1% to ~15%) and 40% as dutasteride-related metabolites (~2% to ~90%). Only trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride were found in urine (&lt;1%). Therefore, on average, the dose unaccounted for approximated 55% (range: 5% to 97%).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The terminal elimination half-life of dutasteride is approximately 5 weeks at steady state. The average steady-state serum dutasteride concentration was 40 ng/mL following 0.5 mg/day for 1 year. Following daily dosing, dutasteride serum concentrations achieve 65% of steady-state concentration after 1 month and approximately 90% after 3 months. Due to the long half-life of dutasteride, serum concentrations remain detectable (greater than 0.1 ng/mL) for up to 4 to 6 months after discontinuation of treatment.</paragraph>

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dutasteride were evaluated in 36 healthy male subjects aged between 24 and 87 years following administration of a single 5-mg dose of dutasteride. In this single-dose trial, dutasteride half-life increased with age (approximately 170 hours in men aged 20 to 49 years, approximately 260 hours in men aged 50 to 69 years, and approximately 300 hours in men older than 70 years). Of 2,167 men treated with dutasteride in the 3 pivotal trials, 60% were age 65 and over and 15% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients.

Two of the 3 major human metabolites have been detected in mice. The exposure to these metabolites in mice is either lower than in humans or is not known.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Han Wistar rats, at doses of 1.5, 7.5, and 53 mg/kg/day in males and 0.8, 6.3, and 15 mg/kg/day in females, there was an increase in Leydig cell adenomas in the testes at 135-fold the MRHD (53 mg/kg/day and greater). An increased incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was present at 52-fold the MRHD (male rat doses of 7.5 mg/kg/day and greater). A positive correlation between proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in circulating luteinizing hormone levels has been demonstrated with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and is consistent with an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis following 5 alpha-reductase inhibition. At tumorigenic doses, luteinizing hormone levels in rats were increased by 167%. In this study, the major human metabolites were tested for carcinogenicity at approximately 1 to 3 times the expected clinical exposure.</paragraph>

The fertility effects were reversed by Recovery Week 6 at all doses, and sperm counts were normal at the end of a 14-week recovery period. The microscopic changes were no longer present at Recovery Week 14 at 0.1 times the MRHD and were partly recovered in the remaining treatment groups. Low levels of dutasteride (0.6 to 17 ng/mL) were detected in the serum of untreated female rats mated to treated males (10 to 500 mg/kg/day for 29 to 30 weeks) which are 16 to 110 times the MRHD based on mean serum concentration. No feminization occurred in male offspring of untreated female rats mated to treated male rats even though detectable blood levels of dutasteride were observed in the female rats.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Symptoms were quantified using the AUA-SI, a questionnaire that evaluates urinary symptoms (incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for a total possible score of 35, with higher numerical total symptom scores representing greater severity of symptoms. The baseline AUA-SI score across the 3 trials was approximately 17 units in both treatment groups.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Subjects receiving dutasteride achieved statistically significant improvement in symptoms versus placebo by Month 3 in 1 trial and by Month 12 in the other 2 pivotal trials.

                              <paragraph>Data from 3 large, well-controlled efficacy trials demonstrate that treatment with dutasteride capsules (0.5 mg once daily) reduces the risk of both AUR and BPH-related surgical intervention relative to placebo, improves BPH-related symptoms, decreases prostate volume, and increases maximum urinary flow rates. These data suggest that dutasteride arrests the disease process of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate.</paragraph>

Trial entry criteria were similar to the double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy efficacy trials described in Section 14.1. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5 alpha-reductase-inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic-antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the combination group, 67% in the group receiving dutasteride, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (identical to the AUA-SI). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24 the mean changes from baseline (±SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (±7.14) for combination, -4.9 (±6.81) for dutasteride, and -4.3 (±7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and dutasteride of -1.3 units (

                  <paragraph>Prostate growth is caused by a hormone in the blood called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dutasteride capsules lower DHT production in the body, leading to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate in most men. While some men have fewer problems and symptoms after 3 months of treatment with dutasteride capsules, a treatment period of at least 6 months is usually necessary to see if dutasteride capsules will work for you.</paragraph>

Your healthcare provider is aware of this effect and can still use PSA to see if you might have prostate cancer. Increases in your PSA levels while on treatment with dutasteride capsules (even if the PSA levels are in the normal range) should be evaluated by your healthcare provider.
